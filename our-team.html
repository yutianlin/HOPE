          <p>
            I joined hope because I think it's beautiful when groups of people from different backgrounds come together for a common cause. From the marginalized demographics we work with, we hear a lot of stories and see for ourselves the passion people have for life, no matter what stage they are in theirs and what struggles they may be facing. As opposed to a lot of charities, HOPE works through mutual aid and long-term partnerships but also leave room for members to initiate projects based on what they see to be issues rising in their communities. This is what I love about what we do.

            I am incredibly inspired by people who overcome their struggles and rise up to become an inspiration to others around them. When doing the Warmth of Winter Stories series in Vancouver's downtown east side, I often find myself hearing more than just stories but rather sharing life with residents that live amongst its streets. On one of the outings this year, I met one of the residents I spoke with a year ago who is now sober and enrolled back into school! Even though we only spoke for a mere hour and a half a year ago, he recognized me and even brought up details of our conversation. This was a very humbling experience and keeps me motivated to continue the work we do.

            I joined HOPE because the three pillars that HOPE works around, namely, student empowerment, outreach within schools, and reaching out towards community groups not only help give back to the community, but also help learn important skills such as leadership, communication, and teamwork. I have always been passionate about helping the marginalized groups in the community and I believe that HOPE is the perfect platform for me to do so. I am excited to be a part of this team full of people with a vision similar to that of mine, a vision to help those in need.

          <p>I joined HOPE a few years ago because I was eager to find a
            club full of students who were passionate about reaching out
            and helping others. HOPE seemed like a perfect fit, because I knew
            I would have the chance to voice my own ideas, while

            already a part of the club.

            applying and going to university, and not having anyone to ask
            questions. I want to help reduce the stress these younger students
            have and help make their transition to university a lot smoother.

            For many students, we're privileged to have a warm place to go home to, and food to eat when we're hungry. But for some people, they don't have that chance to have somewhere to be at night, and they are constantly struggling to find the light at the end of the tunnel in their lives. HOPE brings together students not just from UBC, but also youth from the Lower Mainland to come together to help document and spread awareness on the struggles of those living on the streets of Vancouver.

            I am most passionate about helping youth and women in the Lower Mainland who are homeless or are living in shelters, as well as individuals who are suffering from mental illness or coping with (cyber)bullying. Both population groups are subject to a lot of stigma - not only can these population groups be easily excluded or shunned from the general population, but not enough attention and awareness is raised to help others truly understand the struggles of these 2 groups.

            Being new to both UBC and Vancouver, I believe that UBC HOPE is a great way to familiarize myself with both the school and outside community. Of all the programs at UBC, the message of HOPE resonates with me most. I think it is of the utmost importance to collectively work to better society as a whole; to be able to work with marginalized groups of society benefits both parties in gaining insight into prevalent issues and constructively interconnects the community, as a whole.

            Coalescing the community through constructive synergy with marginalized groups is a purpose both integral to UBC HOPE and something that I have been working towards throughout high school. I have focused on the financially deprived communities around my school, working on both providing tutoring and free piano lessons to those in less fortunate communities. However, I hope to expand my reach to perhaps overlooked marginalized groups and create change around them, as well.

            I hope to apply my technology skills in order to create an interface where people can learn and communicate alongside their peers with special needs. By creating an online community which connects people of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles, I will be apart of fostering new relationships, which is something I would like to spend my life doing.

            I joined HOPE because I want to connect with the campus and discover new opportunities in the community. HOPE gives me the chance to learn and support the marginalized groups, and work with a passionate team to help others via different avenues.

            I joined HOPE to better service my local community through mutual aid which I think is something that differentiates HOPE from a lot of other charities. I was especially drawn to the mentorship program because it is something that I wish I had when transitioning into university. I look forward to working closely with schools and mentoring passionate young individuals during my time at HOPE.

            I am passionate about helping youth because they shape the future of our society. This group will be our future voters, leaders, and pioneers. There are many disadvantaged youth on the streets of Vancouver and I would like to do my part in ensuring a bright future and equal opportunity for all.

            HOPE has been such an amazing organization to me. They gave me guidance during my application and I love to have the opportunity to mentor and provide guidance to others. I am passionate about helping people, no matter the background, whenever and however I can. I believe that HOPE is an amazing and unique organization that offers an great service to incoming students. HOPE's work with marginalized communities is also an important initiative which works to de-stigmatize the stereotypes surrounding the homeless community. HOPE offers them a voice when they cannot speak for themselves, or when they do speak but no one listens.

            Currently, I am passionate about working with two groups of people: those in suburban poverty, and those dealing with mental health issues. Suburban poverty is a problem that grows as the spread of suburbia prevents those dealing with poverty in suburban areas from gaining access to the resources they need. Those in urban areas have more resources (shelters, food banks, etc.), that is lacking in suburban areas. I am also passionate about working with those who are dealing with mental health problems. I have known many people, friends and family included, who struggle with mental health problems and I only want to be able to help them find peace and solace.

            My interests surround the medical field, which although vast, provides with a variety of careers and paths to follow. I want to use my life to better the lives of others, whether that will be achieved through research or as a practicing medical professional. I am interested in psychology and neuroscience because those fields are relatively new and very engaging. It also provides me with the opportunity to work in the field of mental health which I believe is only now becoming recognized as a legitamite health problem.

            I have a general passion for helping people around me especially those who belong to that section of the society where their access to resources are limited.When I had read online about what the HOPE committee exactly does,I was interested in contributing to the committee and on a larger scale,to our society.
