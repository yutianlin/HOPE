            <h2 class="section-heading">Adam</h2>
            <p>
              While strolling down an alleyway towards East Hastings, I noticed a man limping through the dumpsters and heading towards a bench across the street from where I stood.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally, I planned to approach someone who was sitting down, so that conversation could be easier to initiate, but in this almost clichéd dark alley setting, I suddenly felt nervous approaching him. Based on the stereotypes that I have heard about this community, I assumed the worst – that he was a dangerous drug addict that ended up on the streets for being a school drop-out and was just too lazy to find himself a job. But I reminded myself to not be convinced by these stereotypes. I gathered up the courage and crossed the street.
            </p>
            <p>
              As he sat down, I asked him how he was doing. He turned towards me with a bright smile and said “I’m good, yourself?”
            </p>
            <p>
              At once, I noticed the amount of hospital wristbands on his arm.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What happened?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s a long story. I don’t want to talk about it,” he said unconvincingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I reached for the lunch bag I prepared and offered him some food.
            </p>
            <p>
              This seemed to spark some interest in his eyes, and when I asked him about his story, he nodded in approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this, Adam opened up about his life; starting from his adolescent years to today.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the conversation progressed, I was surprised to learn how wrong I was about him.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that Adam was not a school drop-out in our city. In fact, he wasn’t even from our city. He was from Scotland and he moved here with his family to seek a better life. At the age of only 15, he was forced to work in countless skilled trades and labour jobs to provide for his family. From cutting trees to mining diamonds, Adam was exposed to various construction hazards that resulted in multiple trips to the hospital. Eventually, his injuries prevented him from meeting the requirements of numerous jobs. As I listened to his life stories, I couldn’t help but remember how carefree my days were when I was 15.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked him what his hobbies were before he left his high school. He explained that he was part of a band called the Bayview Rollers. Adam fondly remembers that the Baywood neighborhood in the U.S. had inspired that name. He revealed that he had a passion for drawing, especially for sketching and painting nature. Ever since his arrival to Vancouver, he has been expanding his collection. Unfortunately, he did not have any of his artwork with him due to unfortunate circumstances that forced him to leave them all behind. At that moment, he reminded me of my talented friends who love to draw and paint as well. Their paintings are currently hanging on the wall of me and my sibling’s bedroom.
            </p>
            <p>
              After I asked if he also had a sibling, I was saddened to learn that Adam came from a broken family. His sister stayed in Scotland because she had already established a stable job there.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, his mother was a busy woman with four jobs in areas including politics and education. Unfortunately, she left his biological father because he couldn’t support their family. She passed away last year. Once he heard the news from his sister, it was clear that her death still upset him, even though he was separated from her at such a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
              He came to Vancouver with his brother, Angus, who was six years younger than him. When times were better, they had shared an apartment, worked in labour together, and always looked out for each other. Unfortunately, Angus recently passed away as well, due to his poor health.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              I felt disheartened for Adam. I couldn’t imagine myself surviving on my own without my family by my side.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “How do you get by day to day?” I worried.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “I walk around, then come to this bench and sit here till it gets dark. When it rains, it gets worst.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Adam further explained that he is trying to save money to fulfill his desire to return to Scotland and perhaps find his sister, who is still a nurse. “There is not much for me here,” he said quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked very tired. I suddenly noticed the wrinkles on his hands and what I thought was pain in his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowly, I asked him my final question: “What advice would you give to a student at around my age?”
            </p>
            <p>
              He laughed quietly and replied, “stay in school and invest in a job that will support you for the rest of your life.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And it was in that moment that made me realize: Adam was just like me. He was not dangerous at all. Rather, he was just another person who had a family, personal interests, and problems that he had to face day by day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of our age difference, our backgrounds, economic situations, he is like many of us, still struggling to belong and make a place for himself in this world.
