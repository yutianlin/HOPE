            <p>
              As I walked down the streets, a cardboard sign that read “HUNGRY. Money for food, drinks, transportation” caught my attention. The man behind the cardboard was wearing a black waterproof jacket, one of his hands was holding a can of Palm Bay and the other was fiddling with a radio. Lying next to him, was a huge bag of empty bottles. He looked hungry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Would you like something to eat?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sandwich, would do,” he replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              I sat crossed legged on the ground next to him and asked if it was okay if I chatted with him for a while. He happily agreed and took out his cigarette.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Are you allergic?” he asks politely.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was genuinely nice for him to ask me before he lighted up.
            </p>
            <p>
              He told me his name was Nodd and that he was a cab driver for sixteen years. He has been all over BC and especially likes Nelson because of the lakes. To my surprise, he seemed to know his areas real well. He also knows a lot of upcoming music events in Vancouver, but I was curious about how he ended up in Vancouver. When asked, his response shifted the topic. “It’s a long story. I earned quite a lot from my job as a car driver. I moved to Montreal and lived there for 15 years. I didn't like the wind chill there, so I came back.”
            </p>
            <p>
              A woman came by and handed him a five dollar bill. Nodd was happy. He told me that he would use the extra money to collect beer, cigarettes and food. He pointed at the bag of cans and bottles next to him. “This, you see, I would go to the nearest convenient store and exchange it for four dollars.”
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              Four dollars...I thought.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              “I am happy even if I don’t have very much.” Four dollars, a little change and a five dollar bill from the woman is considered as “a lucky day” for Nodd.
            </p>
            <p>
              I only realized it has already been an hour when I could feel the numbness in my legs from sitting too long. As I waved goodbye to my new friend, he had a smile on his face.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Today is a lucky day”.
            </p>
            <p>
              I smiled then, truly reminded that even with very little, it can still be enough. Happiness is not a random accident then, but rather, a choice.
