            <p>
              Behind his snarky smile, aggressive salesmanship, and small storefront on Hastings & Abbott Street, Brett’s story ventures far beyond this short-lived meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              When asked about hobbies, Brett told us he was an avid hockey fan; that he follows the Philadelphia Flyers almost religiously. His love for the game stems from his adverse past. At the age of 15, a hockey scholarship had Brett leave his hometown of Vancouver Island for Saskatchewan, where scouts pursued him as an elite hockey prospect. However, a seemingly routine hit along the boards changed that all. As a result to the injury, 25% mobility was lost in his right ankle, a detrimental blow to his hockey career and ultimately his dreams. Following this devastating injury his outlet proliferated from booze and marijuana to cocaine, and eventually heroine. This lifestyle landed him in “the poorest postal code in North America”, as he put it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, you can catch Brett setting up shop on Hastings with his quirky smile ever-present. Running his laundry business and shop by day, he has a more low-key view on life, spending most of the day freely to himself. He sells knick-knacks and other odds-and-ends at cheap, mostly to keep himself busy through long days and to interact with the community. He is also a participant in a clinical study that tests treatments for people with chronic heron addiction called SALOME (Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness).
            </p>
            <p>
              After meeting Brett there is no doubt he has persevered throughout his life. From being a top hockey prospect to a drug addict to a small time businessman and entrepreneur, he is truly an inspiration. His story and how he has turned himself around has showed us that no matter how bad things get, life isn’t about preventing yourself from falling, but learning how to pick yourself up.
