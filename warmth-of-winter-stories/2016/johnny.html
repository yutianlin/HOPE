              A bit of an unconventional story, I was thoroughly inspired by Johnny andTwo-Four's openness to my questions as a stranger. When asked about their life journey, Johnny shared freely about his past. He used to work in the shipyards loading cargo, but his life turned around when he began his involvement in drug dealing. Being young and naïve, drug dealing to Johnny was “easy money”; he was a big shot for selling large volumes of various drugs and substances. However, the fun and games soon ended when he got involved with seriously bad people that dragged him to prison alongside with them. Prior to prison, Johnny’s life was a downwards spiraling disaster where he got frequently got involved in fights – even one which resulted in him getting his leg shot. Johnny still has a bullet hole and deep scar in his leg.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now out of prison, Johnny roams the streets of Vancouver with his friend Two-Four. Two-Four is a former punk-band member and he too was involved in drug dealing in the past. On the daily, Johnny and Two-Four explore the city, laughing, and living life to the fullest as a dynamic duo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oddly, Johnny does not have any regrets in life, despite the living conditions that he is currently experiencing. Having grown in a rough neighborhood and an unfortunate family situation, he is satisfied that he had gotten out of that lifestyle and moved on to where he is now in the present. Now, Johnny simply tries to do his best to get by everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
              My conversation with Johnny and Two-Four showed me that even without possessing materialistic goods, there are ways to live life to the fullest. Having loving friendships and a positive mind set are more important than material items and by demonstrating these qualities is one step towards a fulfilling life.
