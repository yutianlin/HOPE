            <h2 class="section-heading">Reunion with Dominic</h2>
            <h4>Vivian shares her reunion with Dominic, a familiar face with UBC HOPE</h4>
            <p>
              “Dominic!” I yelled...pretty much halfway across the block.
            </p>
            <p>
              The figure in the contrast gray coat and brown leather cross body bag turned around and I saw Dominic’s face light up in recognition of my familiar face.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do you remember me? I met you last year- right there,” I pointed to the staunch alcove just a few meters away.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yah, Vivian right? And your friend…where’s the tall guy that came with you last year?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eyebrows raised, eyes wide open in disbelief, he remembered my name?
            </p>
            <p>
              A year ago, Dom was an alcoholic who had nowhere to go- spending his nights on the streets and in shelters. I met him on another of HOPE’s Warmth of Winter outreach events. Though I spent close to an hour talking with Dom, never would I have imagined him to remember my name.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes…, I’m Vivian but how did you remember?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dominic merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders as I stood flabbergasted that my conversation with him last year had even left a significant dent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Memories of our conversation flooded in as I suddenly remembered the hollowness in Dom’s voice as he talked about his mother’s passing. “How has your year been, have you been back to visit your family yet?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Actually I got in contact with a cousin, I’ll be back to visit my mother’s grave with him. I’m also back in a heavy metal trades program and I'll be heading to Lake Country to go to school”
            </p>
            <p>
              I couldn’t help but continue to smile- a real smile that wasn’t forced by politeness or the need to entertain, but something that flowed from the joy of witnessing the transformation that took place in Dom’s life.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a beautiful moment to simply reconnect with an old friend- to be steeped in nostalgia and gratitude for this mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is HOPE’s third year in our Warmth of Winter outreach project and I’m glad that I haven’t fallen into routine- that each time I go, I am challenged and inspired and that I leave feeling, on many levels, raw and battered.
            </p>
            <p>
              So that’s what I did, I smiled and laughed together with Dom as he continued on, excited to share the latest news updates on his life with me, who, in his eyes, was not a stranger any longer.
