              We had walked along Hastings and were backtracking once again. For all of us, this was our first time in this initiative and we worried that we would never find someone to approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we encountered Albert and Charlie on the footsteps beside Main and Hastings, and they greeted us happily in return. Albert told us how he had got here: he was kicked out of his home in Prince Rupert after being falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit and his lawyers had abandoned him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these hardships, and thinking how easily it’d be for him to live resentfully, when we asked what makes his day, he simply pointed up – to God. He told us a moving testimony of how God was watching over him when he tried to shoot himself in the head. The gun, though it worked when shooting elsewhere, would not fire when pointed to himself. I told him that there must be a reason he is still alive and he agreed. Albert finds great comfort in reading and has bibles in Chinese, Spanish, and English. He told us about his favourite story of David and Goliath in the bible and asked us how many pebbles David had.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Three, so he could shoot Goliath’s brothers if he had any!”
            </p>
            <p>
              That was Albert, he always asked us questions and spoke with a big smile on his face even in the midst of poignant memories. It was difficult to note how he was truly feeling as he spoke to us, but we certainly felt an intimate authenticity with him. Albert clearly had a positive outlook on life. He told us that he was happy about finding a jacket and bike, and how he should sell the bike at a flea market, seeing he could not ride it. He had tried to ride it before but had almost fallen off. He came off naturally. He spoke lightly of death, even though, unlike us, death grazed him ever so closely. His bravery and optimism motivated me to live with a similar view; perhaps all the struggles he had gone through were just part of a greater plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout our conversation with Albert, Charlie had not spoken, though he listened attentively. His eyes, however, lit up when we mentioned the new Charlie Brown movie coming out. He even told us his favourite character was Snoopy, unlike his name. It was evident they shared a special friendship with each other, and as they were greeted by many friends during our conversation, we could tell those relationships were shared with others too.
            </p>
            <p>
              After we left, we felt very content our first conversation was with these individuals who were willing to share their stories with enthusiasm. We later passed by this spot again, but they were not there anymore. Perhaps they had an appointment or were retiring for the night. But regardless, we will remember how they shared with us their stories of perseverance, of faith and compassion, and that every life works in their own mysterious and unique ways.
