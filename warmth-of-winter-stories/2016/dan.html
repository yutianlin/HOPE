              Walking back to Waterfront station, I couldn’t help but notice a man sitting alone on a street with bright red gloves on. He held a sign that read “You are so good looking” and was waving at the locals passing by, wearing a genuine and killer smile. Intrigued, I sat down next to him and heard his story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raised in Southern Ontario, Dan always enjoyed the bliss of nature. It was this passion that brought him to Vancouver, where he said the outdoors was beautiful. “I always liked what Vancouver brought for me. It’s always so calm and peaceful, plus the weather is great all year round. Really makes for a great view. With nature, you always learn something new. But if you don’t, the beauty of it will always be amazing.”
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “Right now I’m focusing on writing a fantasy novel. It’s going to be great. I always feel so immersed in my stories, and I know one day that my passion for learning will land me in a better place.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Dan also spoke to me about his passion for music. One day he wants to use the money he earns from his book to buy a guitar, and enjoy his hobby again.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Wow, it seems like you have a lot going for you,” I said to him, “Do you have any words or quotes that keep you inspired?"
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yeah. My life advice would be to keep learning life skills. You never know when they may come in handy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Often times we forget that every person has a story, no matter their circumstances. Though we only had a short conversation, Dan gave me a warm smile as I walked back to the sky train station, wondering where the future might take him
