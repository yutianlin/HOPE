            <h2 class="section-heading">Dominic</h2>
            <p>
              Wrapping up for the day, I was headed southeast along East Cordova when I spotted Dominic, his orange windbreaker flapping in the wind. Huddled in the corner outside the steps of a graffiti-ed door, Dominic sat with his bike, two large bags of cans hanging off the sides.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hey, is this seat taken?” I ask with curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally, Dominic’s eyes drift toward mine as he examines first, my overzealous personality and then the two warm cups of coffee and the extra blanket I had balancing on my forearm.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is that?” he asks, his eyes adjusting to the daytime brightness.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Coffees for the both of us,” I reply, sensing this as an entrance into conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              He smiles then— his features contorting into the happy face of a child when offered the last piece of dessert. He moves over to make room on the broken clay tiled stairs and I sit down beside him, offering the extra coffee into his open palms.
            </p>
            <p>
              After asking if he had any hobbies, Dominic promptly told me about his love of potlatches and even explained their significance to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I take after my mother,” he proudly exclaimed, “so I belong to the Bear clan. We have potlatches for everything,” he rattled on, “ when my mom passed away a few months ago, we had a ….potlatch in her honour.”
            </p>
            <p>
              On hearing the news, my heart grew heavy with concern, “do you miss her? Your mom I mean. Were you two close?”
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “Well, yes and no…I was thrown around a lot as a child. A few nights here, a few nights there. I’m actually from New Westminster but my family lives in Prince Rupert. I grew up in foster homes and spent tons of nights on my uncle’s couch. But I hope to go back and visit my family some day.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              We continued our talk about family and the importance of treasuring the people we love. Dominic even shared a story about his girlfriend’s decision to get an abortion which contrasted with his eventual wish to become a father. I listened with growing appreciation for his openness and willingness to share his life stories with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story stalled then and we sat there in silence, enjoying the last rays of sunshine with our coffees thankfully warming our fingers. It wasn't awkward, I didn't feel the rush to think of another question or to comment about the weather. As we soaked in the sun and looked up at the large expanse of the winter skies, I think we both felt at peace, thankful for the day and for each other’s company.
