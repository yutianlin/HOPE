              Intrigued by the sign “starving artist” on a man’s guitar case, I offered him a blanket in efforts of helping an individual in need. He graciously accepted the blanket telling me that his bum has been freezing from sitting on the cold cobblestone floor. His partner urged him to play a song in gratitude for the blanket and he relentlessly agreed. Dru, the guitarist, began playing his rendition of “Wonder Wall” by Oasis while adding his own “style” in the notes and chords here and there.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “Hey, can I tell you ladies a secret,” Dru smirkingly prompts, “I am not actually homeless. In reality, I make over $100.00/ hour as a tattoo artist.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Taken off guard, I asked Dru, “Why do you act as a homeless starving artist when you’re actually a tattoo artist?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s just something that I like to do; it is interesting to see people’s reactions,” Dru replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanking him for the song he played, Dru handed me a business card so that I can get a tattoo. Although I am not planning on getting a tattoo anytime soon, talking to Dru led to an unforgettable conversation and an interesting plot twist for the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              My conversation with Dru allowed me to view society in a different perspective. What are some “masks” that people are concealing from others? Why are people so afraid or are so willing to create a charade that is opposed to their true self? These are several thoughts that left me pondering after my encounter with Dru.
