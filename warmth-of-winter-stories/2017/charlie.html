            <h2 class="section-heading">Matthew’s Reflection</h2>

            <p>He came from Victoria and has spent the last two years without
              a home. He is entangled with drug addiction, and arrived at
              Vancouver three months ago. I asked him what he thought of the
              big city, he said there are both ups and downs, that it was an
              international city, but the situation with people living on the
              streets is amplified by the scale and size of Vancouver.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I see these empty buildings being brought up”, he showed immense
              criticism towards the situation with property and treatments
              towards the homeless, a single shelter can take on different
              systems depending on the person in charge, thus it wasn't a
              stable place to be, it wasn't a home.
            </p>
            <p>
              He wasn’t a man that would commit to criminal acts, not willingly
              by his own standards, but how long can a person stay to their
              ways until they break out? When they are desperately hungry, in
              need for clothes to prepare for the cold weather, how long would
              it take for them to “cross the line”?
            </p>
            <p>
              He said 6-9 months, that was how long he lasted for before
              having to step out of his comfort zone, to take actions for
              his survival. I asked him what he thinks is the “first step”
              to solve all the issues he is facing, he said “a place to live,
              a place where I can safely store my things”. To travel and move
              from place to place he needed a passport, however it was stolen.
              He was able to apply and obtain his birth certificate only to be
              stolen again. He is a man with no family, absent of support from
              a social group, he can only keep on going for so long until he
              feels deteriorated and becomes unmotivated. “If I apply for it
              again, and it gets stolen, then what’s the point?”
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked about jobs opportunities, would getting a job help, he
              said yes but that isn’t the first step, nor is it anywhere
              close.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “We aren’t even allowed in shops to buy food even if we
              had money because of the way we look. We can’t buy new clothes
              either, so how will we be fit for work if we cannot have a
              healthy diet?”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              It is a vicious cycle he is living through,
              which leads back to his point, are all these really his fault?
              If he steals or commits an offence, it is because he hasn’t
              been given much of a choice, he is doing whatever he can to
              survive and as he said, he believes he can only remain sane
              and stick to his moral guidelines for so long until being
              consumed by this lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
              With each attempt he took to change his life, from applying
              for his birth certificate, to trying to live in shelters, all
              went flip side which pushed him back out into the streets.
              The cycle continues and it will only get worst if there is no
              one to stop it, someone to make the homeless feel secured,
              protected and to not feel vulnerable by giving them a place
              to live, to be treated well, fed well. They are humans too,
              just as capable as any other, they just need more of a push, a
              head start to rear them out from where they are right now, and
              to be able to sustain themselves after all the hardships, the
              scarring they have gone through.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              Lastly, I asked him of his childhood dreams, “When I was a kid,
              we were brought to the science museum and I got to ride in this
              underwater capsule that simulated travelling in the ocean.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I want to travel.” I think it is important for him to remember
              this, a distant image able to rear him back to realisation that
              there is something to look forward to. However, if the case is
              bad, this image would only remind him of what seems to be a
              cemented, recurring cycle, and that is an absolute tragedy.
              He should not be reminded of his current fate, but how it could
              change. He should have the right to make up for his decisions,
              and not penalised by the poor outlook of other people.

            <p>
              When you walk through downtown you tend to be fully focused
              on wherever you’re rushing to, or whoever you’re with. Warmth
              of Winter gives you the chance to take the time to focus on
              what, and who, is around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              As my partner Matthew and I
              left waterfront station, we were somewhat hesitant on
              approaching residents of the Downtown Eastside Community. It’s
              not everyday that you initiate conversations with complete
              strangers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we walked towards Hastings however, we saw a man
              sitting with a bag and a box of cereal. He seemed like he wasn’t
              busy and I figured, I may as well gather my courage and just try
              to go up to him, since we had to talk to someone eventually.
              I’m not the most outgoing person out there, but I decided to,
              essentially, yolo it and try my luck at being more extroverted.
            </p>
            <p>
              We approached the man, who was named Charlie, and it was a lot
              easy to strike up a conversation than I expected. We sat with him
              for about an hour, and I didn’t even notice the time going by.
              The only reason we ended up leaving was because we didn’t have
              much longer to give out the rest of our care packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Charlie
              had a lot of ideas about how Vancouver could try and improve
              the homelessness situation. He had dreams of taking a road trip.
              He struggled to replace his stolen passport. The conversation
              flowed as it would between debating friends, which is honestly
              not something that I expected. He informed me about things I
              didn’t even know were happening in the community, and I got the
              opportunity to see a completely different perspective on life.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              The biggest thing, though, that I got out of the exchange was
              how easy it can be to talk to someone. All you have to do is
              take the first step and reach out.
