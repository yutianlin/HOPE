            <h2 class="section-heading">Gus</h2>
            <p>
              I saw Gus sitting with crutches and a striped hospital band on
              the steps on the corner of Main and Hastings. It was the alcove
              where I’ve met residents before though I’ve never seen Gus at
              this spot.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a brief hello, Gus explained that he was a
              traveller at heart- having lived in areas such as such as
              Chicago, Oregon, Toronto, and other Canadian cities.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              His answer for why he chose to stay in Vancouver since the 1980s
              was simply: community.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              As if it were planned, his buddy stopped
              by and told him about the sleeping bag that a group was giving
              out for free today and asked if Gus wanted half his sandwich.
              Gus merely winked with a sparkle in his eye and pointed to the
              lunch we were having before settling back into our conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked Gus about his trip to the hospital and he explained that
              he recently had to get twenty stitches on his thigh. Through
              bits of his sandwich, Gus had no complaints about the quality
              of care that he received in the ER. He chatted on about doctors
              who do their everyday job and laughed at the memory of the young
              physician who joked with him to make his stay at the hospital a
              little brighter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though we didn’t have too long of a conversation,
              Gus wanted this post to be a little shout-out to the everyday
              heroes; the difference you make may be greater than it seems.
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Vivian’s Reflection</h2>

            <p>Oftentimes, we hear about the stories of residents of the
              downtown eastside who are treated unfairly or face inequalities
              fueled by societal stereotypes when they walk into the
              emergency.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              However, Gus’ story was a simple reminder that
              everyday unsung heroes and their stories are masked by
              selective media posts and that every news broadcast is biased
              on some level.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Although Gus’ story can by no means replace
              statistics and news stories, it gave me a renewed sense of hope
              in how individuals can make a difference in the lives of those
              who fall into marginalized population groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              As someone who
              hopes to pursue a future career in this field, Gus gave insight
              as to the impact that even a little moment of laughter can have
              in a bleak emergency room. Though to some, this might seem
              insignificant...unnecessary even, it points to a larger value
              at play: care. The care that healthcare professionals give their
              patients and the moments when we take a break from just counting
              the numbers on charts, the dashes and lines on an EKG, to
              remember that we are treating human beings and not just their
              diagnoses.
