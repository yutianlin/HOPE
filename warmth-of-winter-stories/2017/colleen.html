            <h2 class="section-heading">Captain Colleen</h2>
            <p>
              I met Captain Colleen while she was sitting on the steps of a building holding one arm in the other. With a food packet in my hand I approached her hesitantly and asked how her day was going to which she responded by shifting her hat to look at me with teary eyes and whispered “I’m not doing well". Having never been in a situation like this I stood there quietly taken aback by her sad voice then got down on my knees to sit parallel to her. I asked her what happened and she started crying harder and exclaimed in a loud voice " it took her it took my sister." confused, I pushed further with another question " who did?" she again shifted her hat held out her hand and started to cry loudly. I gave my hand to her and she squeezed it trying to balance her trembling body.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the next little while I held her hand, stroked her arm and assured her everything would be fine until she was ready to talk. I again offered her food and she cheered up a little knowing I had fruit juice for her and with great excitement told me she loved fruit especially peaches. After settling down with the juice she told me that earlier she found out that her sister had drowned in the Yukon River and she couldn’t pay her respects because she had traveled to Vancouver to be with her brother who had cancer and to meet up with her daughter and granddaughter, heaven colleen. Due to a recent injury to her collarbone captain was unable to find her daughter so she remained with her brother instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearing the end of our conversation I asked her if there was anything I could do to help her and she requested I walk her back to the woman’s shelter and help her contact a rehab facility for her alcohol addiction. As she leaned on my shoulder we walked to the shelter while she told me she got the name captain from working in a mine in the Yukon where she was the “boss”. As I left her at the shelter with the number of a rehab facility colleen expressed her gratitude multiple times with tears in her eyes.

              As I got ready to say goodbye captain told me she doesn’t believe in goodbyes instead she yelled after me as I walked through the door, “LOVE YOU LATER”.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Maida’s Reflection</h2>

            <p>As someone who had never been to downtown eastside my
              knowledge of the community was based off of the experiences
              of other people and what the media chose to portray about
              homelessness. Several times I had considered not attending
              this event due to fear but in the end decided it was great
              chance to share the stories of the members of downtown eastside
              without bias.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I arrived at Cordova Street I had no idea what
              to expect was absolutely heartbroken when I saw people huddling
              for warmth outside of buildings and the endless line of people
              in front of the local soup kitchen.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              It boggled my mind that
              with all of the empty buildings around many members of the
              community had no escape from the chilling weather.

              From a
              distance it looked as if nobody wanted to be disturbed and
              as we walked by we were readily ignored. However we introduced
              ourselves to this young woman named Dee and as we offered her
              a food packet and asked her questions about the neighbourhood
              I started to relax and began listening to what she had to say.
              Soon after Dee’s sister and friend, Red, joined us, my partner
              Vivian decided to take a selfie and keep the conversation going.
              As I listened in and saw the excitement in their eyes from taking
              just one selfie I began to change the image I had in my mind
              about what this community actually was.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was apparent that
              members of the community looked after one another and had great
              insight about the dilemma that downtown eastside faced and the
              lack of positive involvement from other communities. This
              experience completely altered my previous beliefs about a
              community I was told so much about but never tried to
              understand.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              I hope the personal stories of residents of
              eastside helps remove stigma against the community and urges
              us to get involved and be more vocal about these relevant issues.
