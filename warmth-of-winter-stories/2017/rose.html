              I’m not originally from Vancouver. I’m from Montreal, but I
              moved out here back when I was in my twenties to meet my dad
              for the first time. When we met, it didn’t work out and we
              parted ways once again. However, he contacted me a year before
              he died and gave me a handwritten birthday card that said
              “I love you”. That was the first time I heard those words from
              him. I still have it with me.
            </p>

              Even though I spilled coffee all
              over it a couple of years ago, I still kept it and cherish it
              to this day.

              I don’t live with my family. My parents passed away a while
              ago and I’m the only child so it’s been pretty lonely. I live
              in a place nearby with a nurse who lives down the hall and
              takes care of me.
            </p>

              The biggest piece of advice I have to offer is don’t tell
              yourself that you can’t do something because that causes
              so much negativity. If you truly want to do something, just
              go for it and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Leslie and Jenny’s Reflection</h2>

            <p>As we were talking to Rose, a man approached her from behind
              and kissed her on the cheek. He spoke softly into her ear,
              ran his hands along her shoulders, and then walked away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rose told us that she’s known the man for 10-20 years now and
              that was something that he did to her every day. She’s tried
              to push him away and tell him that it makes her uncomfortable,
              but he always persists and there’s not much she can do about
              it since she is confined to a wheelchair and doesn’t have full
              function of her hands. It breaks my heart to see that she’s
              being taken advantage of because of her physical situation;
              she has to put up with these unwanted advances because she is
              physically limited and unable to prevent it from happening. As
              a woman, I frequently worry about how to deal with unwanted
              physical advances from men and I can’t imagine how powerless
              she feels in her situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As our conversation progressed, a woman dressed in a black
              t-shirt and black jeans approached Rose and discretely handed
              her a small bag of white powder. In exchange, Rose lifted up
              her leg up in the wheelchair to reveal a stack of bills. She
              was having trouble handing the woman $5 amongst her stack of
              bills with her disfigured hands. Rose asked the woman if she
              would mind taking the money herself. The woman bent over and
              took the money from underneath her leg, exactly $5. She thanked
              Rose and continued on her way down the street.

              This was the first time that I witnessed a drug transaction and
              it never struck me how easy it was to access drugs, both their
              abundance and the relative inexpensive price, in the Downtown
              Eastside. It was interesting to see that even though not all
              members of the Downtown Eastside have access to a cellphone,
              they are able to organize themselves to carry out these
              transactions. It’s evident that the community is very close;
              everyone along the street that we were walking along knew each
              other and who to contact if they ever needed a fix.

              Although some individuals are at more of a disadvantage, they do not take
              advantage of each other for personal gain. It’s heartwarming to
              see that although they are trying their best to survive on their
              own, they don’t want to do it at the cost of others’ ability to
              do the same.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The community of the Downtown Eastside may be
              scattered across a large area, but they are also a close
              community that watches out for each other.

              One of the big things I realized from participating in Warmth
              of Winter was how easy it was for us to just pack some food and
              distribute to the Vancouver East side community. I plan on
              gathering a couple of my friends to create our own “Warmth of
              Winter” group and go down there more often so I can build more
              of a long-term relationship with them. One of the downsides
              was that a lot of them were not willing to share their personal
              stories with us which is understandable since we had just met
              them so I think visiting them on regular basis and building a
              relationship with them would help us identify their real
              situation and their needs.
