            <h2 class="section-heading">Tim</h2>
            <p>
              Tim initially hesitated, “None of my stories can be articulated
              into words.”  Instead of pushing him further, we were open to
              discuss how he found his niche in the Downtown Eastside community.
              Tim eventually opened up to us, recalling his hitchhike across
              Canada after abandoning higher education.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Freedom is not something you find. You just are free. It's not
              something you have, it's a ‘beingness’. Travelling is a means
              of letting go of everything. I was consumed by finding a job,
              girlfriend, prosperity. It’s always stuff and things. In the end
              I still wasn't free.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Tim’s journey ended off with an epiphany. He came to a
              realization alone in the forest, with nothing but the clothes on
              his back and his sleeping gear.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “When you let go of everything, you realize the only thing left
              is you. And you start to become free.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The words he conveyed rung with much truth and sincerity.
              His journeys in his life had really shaped him and his values.
            </p>
            <p>
              After traversing across Canada, Tim found himself coming back to
              Vancouver. Above all, he missed the humidity and life that the
              Vancouver rain could provide nowhere else.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              “I feel a more substantial happiness, deeply seeded inside.
              It's made me a happy person inside and I've never been a happy
              person inside before.”
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">But no matter the circumstance, “You have who you are inside.
              You can still be happy.”

            <h2 class="section-heading">Simon’s Reflection</h2>

            <p>Stigma surrounding those living on the streets commonly pervades
              the mindset of well-to-do citizens like ourselves. But after
              listening to their stories today made us realize how much they
              have persevered through the challenges in their life.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              It’s really inspiring to see how those on the streets still are
              pursuing their dreams and not letting anything hold them back.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Our conversation with Tim showed us how, through intrinsic
              motivation, you can achieve and learn anything you want to.
              Even quantum physics and philosophy, subjects Tim liked to
              absorb himself in.
            </p>
            <p>
              In today's day and age, we rely so much on
              extrinsic motivation in school through grades, professors,
              parents. We need reassurance and rewards in order to learn.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              His way of learning reminds us to pursue the things you love and to
              delve deep in knowledge for personal benefit and nothing else.
            </blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>
              Like Tim said, you’ll always have who you are inside. Nothing
              from the outside can inherently make you happy - only the way
              you interpret it. Happiness is difficult to seek, especially if
              you look for it in the outside world, where things come and go.
              Sometimes it takes a lifetime to find, and may not come in the
              shape or form that you envision it to be.
