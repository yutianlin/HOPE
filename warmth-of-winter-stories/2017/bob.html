            <h2 class="section-heading">Bob</h2>
            <p>
              Bob was sitting at the corner of Thurlow and Robson Street when
              we saw first him. He claimed that he was there everyday,
              “eight days a week”.
            </p>
            <p>
              He likes to display a nametag. Unfortunately he loses it
              everyday; sometimes it’s because the
              rain washes it away.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              However, what stood out the most was his
              sharp red Santa hat. Aside from it being warm, Bob really likes
              being festive for the holidays.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              He was originally from Ontario
              and has travelled through Winnipeg, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.
              Eventually, he ended up in Vancouver and did not go any further
              because he would reach the ocean. Ever since, he’s been in this
              city for 36 years!
            </p>
            <p>
              He confided us that we came at just the right
              time because he was really hungry; he was thinking about eating
              the bark from the trees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bob likes to read his bible because he
              believes that the content inside contains a lot of truth and that
              a Holy man had written it. Unfortunately, it got stolen. Lastly,
              when asked about what he would like, he stated that he would want
              us to pray for him and people like him in this world.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Vivian's Reflection</h2>

            <p>This conversation with Bob led me to understand more about
              what the downtown homeless community needs. It’s not just about
              possessing hunger for food; it’s about having a need to feel
              included, to know that people care and to have some faith.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the challenges he faces everyday, Bob remains optimistic and
              approaches life with a grin. It was really heartwarming to listen
              to the stories of the happy-go-lucky man with a cheerful Santa hat.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my peers and I gave him a sandwich and had a meaningful
              conversation with him, I left with a powerful, inspired feeling
              that I wanted to do more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically for Bob, we plan to get
              him a bible to replace the one he lost. Also, we want to give
              him a photo of himself and a photo we took with him. He had
              expressed with regret that he only had one picture of himself
              after all these years.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              I hope that we can all spare some time to
              pray for Bob and people like him. Best wishes during this
              holiday season!</blockquote>
