            <p>
              We met Tyler at the corner of Howe st and Robson st. He came
              all the way from Ontario with his dog, Lokey. He’s had him for
              3 years since he was a puppy. It took them about two weeks to
              get to Vancouver from Ontario through hitch hiking. He says
              even though it is much wetter in Vancouver he likes it here
              better than Ontario because it’s warmer and people are nice.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Christine's Reflection</h2>

            <p>It was a little difficult approaching people at first
              because I was not sure whether they would be willing to talk
              to us or not. However, after about third time, I felt more
              natural talking to them and asking them questions about their
              journey and life in Vancouver.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              Tyler did not talk much and he
              apologized for being shy but I could tell that he had a big
              heart from the way he looked at his dog and how he truly loved him.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              One of the big things I realized from participating in Warmth
              of Winter was how easy it was for us to just pack some food
              and distribute to the Vancouver East side community. I plan
              on gathering a couple of my friends to create our own “Warmth
              of Winter” group and go down there more often so I can build
              more of a long-term relationship with them. One of the downsides
              was that a lot of them were not willing to share their personal
              stories with us which is understandable since we had just met
              them so I think visiting them on regular basis and building a
              relationship with them would help us identify their real
              situation and their needs.
